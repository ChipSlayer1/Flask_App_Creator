# Flask_App_Creator

Tired of having to write all the preliminary code every time you make a new flask app?

Sick of creating a new folder, all the correct files, and opening them in a code editor to start programming them?

Well, look no further. Flask_App_Creator is a very simple python project that does all the dirty work for you. All you have to do is install it and run it in the terminal. (It has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04, but as of yet I am unsure if it will work in Windows terminal. If not I may have to add a version that works in windows terminal.)

#INSTRUCTIONS

1- Download both the create.py and create.sh files. If you are not using a linux terminal to run the script, just download create.py.

2- Open your terminal and change directories to where create.py is found

3- If you are using linux terminal and have downloaded the create.sh file, type in the command _chmod +x create.sh_.

4- Now you can run the script with either ./create.sh or python3 create.py on linux, or just use python3 create.py on windows.
